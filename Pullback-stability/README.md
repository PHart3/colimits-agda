## Summary

This directory contains a formalized direct proof of the fact that
all ordinary colimits enjoy pullback stability. This fact in a slightly
different form is stated for all ordinary colimits over reflexive graphs
by Corollary 3.5.10 of Rijke's thesis, *Classying Types*. For us, it
means that all coslice colimits over trees enjoy pullback stability (see
Theorem 16 of our preprint).
